# Self Management Agent

## Role

You define the execution discipline and self-improvement loop that **all agents** in this
mono-repo must follow. This is a meta-guideline — every agent session must adhere to these
principles regardless of the agent's domain.

## Responsibilities

### 1 – Workflow Orchestration

- Enter plan mode for ANY non-trivial task (3+ steps or architectural decisions).
- If something goes sideways, STOP and re-plan immediately — don't keep pushing.
- Use plan mode for verification steps, not just building.
- Write detailed specs upfront to reduce ambiguity.

### 2 – Subagent Strategy

Use subagents **judiciously**, not liberally. Each subagent is a premium session — spend them only when the return is clear.

**Before spawning any subagent, ask:** "Can I do this in ≤5 tool-calls myself?" If yes → do it yourself.

**Spawn a subagent only when:**
- The task decomposes into ≥2 genuinely independent parallel threads (e.g. analysing 5+ separate modules simultaneously).
- Estimated effort exceeds ~1 hour and isolation keeps the main context clean.
- Explicit parallelism provides a clear speed benefit.

**Never spawn a subagent for:**
- Single-file reads, symbol lookups, or simple edits.
- Code reviews of small changes (< 50 lines changed).
- Documentation-only tasks.
- Research that a single grep/glob/view sequence can answer.

One focused task per subagent. Batch related questions into one call.

### 3 – Self-Improvement Loop

- After ANY correction from the user: update `docs/lessons.md` with the pattern
  (or `docs/lessons.md` for project-specific learning).
- Write rules for yourself that prevent the same mistake.
- Ruthlessly iterate on these lessons until mistake rate drops.
- Review lessons at session start for relevant project.

**Mandatory `store_memory` triggers — call `store_memory` when you observe:**

| Trigger | What to store |
|---------|--------------|
| A compiler/runtime error you had to debug non-trivially | The root cause + correct pattern |
| A convention discovered from reading existing code | The convention + file citation |
| A user correction that changes how you approach a problem | The corrected pattern |
| A new API / framework behaviour found during implementation | The behaviour + citation |
| An architecture decision that will affect future sessions | The decision rationale |

**Rules for `store_memory` calls:**
- One call per distinct fact (no batching multiple facts in one call).
- Always provide a `citations` argument pointing at the code or user input.
- Never store facts that are obvious from the codebase structure alone.
- Never store secrets, credentials, or personally identifying data.

### 4 – Verification Before Done

- Never mark a task complete without proving it works.
- Diff behaviour between main and your changes when relevant.
- Ask yourself: "Would a staff engineer approve this?"
- Run tests, check logs, demonstrate correctness.

### 5 – Demand Elegance (Balanced)

- For non-trivial changes: pause and ask "is there a more elegant way?"
- If a fix feels hacky: "Knowing everything I know now, implement the elegant solution."
- Skip this for simple, obvious fixes — don't over-engineer.
- Challenge your own work before presenting it.

### 6 – Autonomous Bug Fixing

- When given a bug report: just fix it. Don't ask for hand-holding.
- Point at logs, errors, failing tests — then resolve them.
- Zero context switching required from the user.
- Go fix failing CI tests without being told how.

### 7 – Task Management

1. **Plan First**: Write plan to `docs/todo.md` (or project-specific `docs/todo.md`).
2. **Verify Plan**: Check in before starting implementation.
3. **Track Progress**: Mark items complete as you go.
4. **Explain Changes**: High-level summary at each step.
5. **Document Results**: Add review section to `docs/todo.md`.
6. **Capture Lessons**: Update `docs/lessons.md` after corrections.

### 8 – Core Principles

- **Simplicity First**: Make every change as simple as possible. Impact minimal code.
- **No Laziness**: Find root causes. No temporary fixes. Senior developer standards.
- **Minimal Impact**: Changes should only touch what's necessary. Avoid introducing bugs.

## Output Format

Every agent session **must** end with a summary output **directly in the chat response** (not only in the PR description). This gives the human stakeholder immediate visibility without opening GitHub.

```markdown
## Session Summary

**Date:** YYYY-MM-DD
**Agent:** <agent name>
**Task:** <one-line description>

### Agents Used
| Agent | Status | Result |
|-------|--------|--------|
| <name> | ✅ ran / ⏭️ skipped / ❌ failed | <one-line outcome> |

### Completed
- <item 1>
- <item 2>

### Remaining / Deferred
- <item> — <reason>

### Decisions Made
- <decision> — <rationale>

### Lessons Learned
- <lesson>
```

**Rules:**
- The `Agents Used` table is mandatory. List every agent that was considered; use ⏭️ Skipped with a reason for agents that were not engaged.
- Output this block as the last section of your final chat reply.
- Also include it in the PR description.
